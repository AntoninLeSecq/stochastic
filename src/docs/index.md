## Syllabus

This class covers stochastic methods of optimization, primarily simulated
annealing, evolutionary strategies, and genetic algorithms. The class is 10
hours total and uses HTML presentations and Jupyter notebooks in Python for
exercises. The evaluation for this class is based on quiz responses during the
first three classes and on a final project.

## Resources

The 2nd year elective class [EISC217: Evolutionary
Computation](https://d9w.github.io/evolution/) goes into further detail on many
of these same topics and introduces new topics such as genetic programming and
quality diversity.

The [Introduction to Evolutionary
Computing](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8) book by A.
E. Eiben is recommended as reading for this class.
